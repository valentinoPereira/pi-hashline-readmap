# AGENTS.md — Developer & Agent Guide

Repo-local guide for working on `pi-hashline-readmap`.

## What This Project Is

`pi-hashline-readmap` is a unified [pi](https://github.com/mariozechner/pi-coding-agent) extension that replaces several built-in tools with enhanced versions:

- `read` — hashlined reads, structural maps, symbol-addressable reads
- `edit` — hash-anchored edits with semantic diff summaries
- `grep` — hashlined search results
- `ast_search` — ast-grep wrapper with hashlined output
- `bash` filtering — command-aware output compression

The extension is loaded via an absolute path entry in `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`'s `extensions` array (pointing at this workspace's `index.ts`, or at `dist/index.js` after `npm run build` for fast startup), so **new agent sessions** pick up local edits automatically. Running sessions do **not** hot-reload the module graph — restart any in-flight agent session to see changes take effect.

## Version Control

This repo is currently operated as a normal git repo with GitHub PRs. Do not assume `jj` is configured here.

Standard flow:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull --ff-only origin main
git checkout -b feat/my-feature
# edit / test
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: my feature description"
git push -u origin feat/my-feature
gh pr create --base main --head feat/my-feature
```

After merge:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull --ff-only origin main
git branch -d feat/my-feature
```

Use `git branch -D` only after verifying the work is on `origin/main`.

### Megapowers-managed work

When `/mega on` is active, do not run ad-hoc branch/commit/push commands outside the allowed workflow moments. Use megapowers tools for phase changes and TDD signals. Post-merge cleanup on local `main` is the main exception.

## Development

Prereqs:

```bash
node --version   # >= 22.19.0
npm install
```

Useful optional tools:

```bash
brew install ast-grep
brew install difftastic
brew install shellcheck yq scc
```

Validation:

```bash
npm run build   # bundles dist/index.js (also run by pretest/prepare)
npm test
npm run typecheck
```

### Shippable build contract

Pi loads extensions through jiti, which resolves a TypeScript import graph
file-by-file at startup (multi-second cost on Windows; the `dist/` bundle is
the fix). The build invariants below are pinned by `tests/dist-build.test.ts`
and `scripts/build.mjs` — keep them when touching the build:

- The shippable entry is the single bundled `dist/index.js`; `package.json`
  declares it in both `pi.extensions` and `exports`. Pi's directory discovery
  falls back to `index.ts` when `dist/` is absent, which keeps unbuilt
  checkouts working (slowly).
- `dist/package.json` sets `{ "type": "commonjs" }` **on purpose**: it keeps
  the ESM-syntax bundle on jiti's transform path so the transformed `require`
  calls go through pi's resolver alias map. That map routes
  `@earendil-works/*` and `typebox` to the host's own copies — those peers are
  deliberately absent from installed extension trees, so a native import
  would fail (or load a skewed second copy). Do not remove this file, do not
  bundle the pi peers in, and do not expect `dist/index.js` to load via native
  Node import.
- Runtime assets (`prompts/`, `scripts/`) resolve from the package root via
  `src/package-root.ts` in both the `src/` and `dist/` layouts. Never derive
  asset paths from a module's own directory.

### Independent current-host compatibility

`npm test` runs the loader smoke test and real tool-pipeline regression against the locked development host. `.github/workflows/pi-compatibility.yml` separately installs exactly Pi 1.0.0 into runner temporary storage and runs `tests/pi-host-null-pipeline.test.ts` and `tests/pi-host-codemode.test.ts` through that installation's loader, wrapper, agent-core pipeline, ExtensionRunner, and real codemode executor. Its npm 11/12 matrix also verifies both `npm pack --json` result shapes. Do not replace either host lane with the other. The pinned version lives in `PI_COMPAT_VERSION` in `tests/pi-host-null-pipeline.test.ts`; bump it together with the workflow and the commands below.

Reproduce the independent lane locally (no global Pi, credentials, or provider needed). Pin the Pi dependency graph as well as the host because its internal caret ranges otherwise allow newer versions:

```bash
host_prefix=$(mktemp -d)
trap 'rm -rf -- "$host_prefix"' EXIT
npm install --prefix "$host_prefix" --no-save --package-lock=false --no-audit --no-fund \
  @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent@1.0.0 \
  @earendil-works/pi-agent-core@1.0.0 \
  @earendil-works/pi-ai@1.0.0 \
  @earendil-works/pi-tui@1.0.0 \
  @earendil-works/pi-mcp@1.0.0 \
  @earendil-works/pi-codemode@1.0.0 \
  @earendil-works/pi-telemetry@1.0.0 \
  @earendil-works/chord@1.0.0
PI_COMPAT_HOST="$host_prefix/node_modules/@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent" PI_COMPAT_REQUIRE_NU=1 npm test -- tests/pi-host-null-pipeline.test.ts tests/pi-host-codemode.test.ts
```

An explicitly supplied host must be exactly 1.0.0; wrong/missing installations fail without local fallback. `PI_COMPAT_REQUIRE_NU=1` requires the optional Nu tool to register in this lane. `tests/pi-host-codemode.test.ts` skips on the locked 0.84.2 host, which has no codemode. Current-host checks are deterministic runtime checks; `npm run typecheck` still uses the locked development declarations. See [structured-output null contracts](docs/structured-output.md#required-nulls-at-the-host-boundary) for Pi's preparation-error metadata limitation and [codemode integration](docs/structured-output.md#codemode-integration) for the script-facing contract.

Follow-up scope: exhaustive nested-union input auditing, all ExtensionRunner lifecycle branches, AgentSession/provider integration, and a separate current-host declaration typecheck are not claimed by these checks. No registered tool is deliberately excluded from the shared guard.

## Source map

- `index.ts` — extension entry point (TypeScript source entry and unbuilt fallback)
- `src/read.ts`, `src/edit.ts`, `src/grep.ts`, `src/sg.ts`, `src/nu.ts` — core tool implementations
- `src/*-output.ts`, `src/*-render-helpers.ts` — tool result shaping / rendering
- `src/package-root.ts` — package-root asset path resolution (prompts/, scripts/)
- `src/readmap/` — structural mapping, symbol lookup, language detection, per-language mappers
- `src/rtk/` — bash output routing and compression techniques
- `prompts/` — tool prompt/schema docs
- `scripts/` — helper scripts used by readmap internals + `build.mjs` (dist bundling)
- `dist/` — built shippable entry (generated by `npm run build`)
- `tests/` — feature-focused tests and fixtures

## Common changes

### New language mapper

1. Add `src/readmap/mappers/<lang>.ts`
2. Register it in `src/readmap/mapper.ts`
3. Update `src/readmap/language-detect.ts`
4. Add tests in `tests/readmap-mappers-files.test.ts` and any focused integration tests needed
5. Set `export const MAPPER_VERSION = 1` in the new mapper file. Bump it any time the mapper's output shape changes so the persistent map cache (`src/persistent-map-cache.ts`) invalidates stale entries.

### New bash compression technique

1. Add implementation under `src/rtk/`
2. Register it in `src/rtk/index.ts`
3. Add/update focused `tests/rtk-*.test.ts`
4. Verify `tests/bash-filter.test.ts` still covers the routing correctly

### Tool output contract change

When changing `read`, `edit`, `grep`, or `ast_search` output:

1. Update the relevant `*-output.ts` / render helper modules
2. Update `prompts/` docs if the contract changed
3. Add/update tests that pin user-visible behavior
4. Check `README.md` examples if behavior changed materially
5. If the change affects a mapper's output shape, bump that mapper's `MAPPER_VERSION` in `src/readmap/mappers/<lang>.ts` so the persistent map cache invalidates stale entries.

## Local-only / ignored state

The repo intentionally ignores or treats as local-only state such as:

- `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `coverage/`, `.vite/`, `tmp/`, `.cache/`
- `.megapowers/`, `.pi/`, `.kotadb/`, `.gh-status.json`
- editor/machine-local files like `.vscode/`, `.idea/`, `.zellij*`, `.npmrc`
- local planning docs like `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `BUILD-PLAN.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `PRD.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `AGENT-NATIVE-TOOLS.md`, `docs/features/`
- transient artifacts like `*.log`, `*.tgz`, `*.tsbuildinfo`, `.env*`

Delete temporary debugging files before finishing.

## Publishing

```bash
npm pack --dry-run
npm publish
```

The `prepare` script builds `dist/` automatically on pack, publish, and git
installs, so published packages always ship the bundled entry.

Install from npm:

```bash
pi install npm:pi-hashline-readmap
```

Install from git:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/coctostan/pi-hashline-readmap
```
