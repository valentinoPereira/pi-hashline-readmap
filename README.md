Upgrade Pi's local coding workflow with hash-anchored reads and edits, structural navigation, safer file exploration, and quieter command output.

`pi-hashline-readmap` replaces Pi's `read`, `edit`, `grep`, `write`, `ls`, and `find`; adds enhanced `ast_search`; optionally adds `nu`; and post-processes `bash`.

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:pi-hashline-readmap
```

Requires Pi extension support and Node.js 22.19 or newer. Start a new Pi session after installing; sessions do not hot-reload extensions.

### Validated compatibility baseline

Development, schema validation, and extension-load testing use the exact Pi version resolved by `package-lock.json`, currently Pi 0.84.2, with TypeBox 1.3.7. Pi provides `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`, `@earendil-works/pi-tui`, and `typebox` to loaded extensions, so those host-bundled packages intentionally retain `"*"` peer ranges; the development dependencies and lockfile record the versions validated by this repository.

Run the compatibility coverage through the normal test suite or by itself:

```bash
npm test
npm test -- tests/pi-extension-load-compatibility.test.ts tests/pi-host-null-pipeline.test.ts
npm run typecheck
```

The suite exercises the real locked-host tool pipeline as well as extension loading. [Compatibility CI](https://github.com/coctostan/pi-hashline-readmap/actions/workflows/pi-compatibility.yml) independently provisions exactly Pi 1.0.0. Through that host's loader, wrapper, agent-core pipeline, and `ExtensionRunner`, it checks required-null rejection, `structuredContent` passthrough, and real codemode scripts. An npm 11/12 matrix verifies both array and keyed-object `npm pack --json` output. This runtime lane does not replace the locked development baseline or typecheck; see [AGENTS.md](https://github.com/coctostan/pi-hashline-readmap/blob/main/AGENTS.md) to reproduce it.

The extension and the exact Pi host version resolved by `package-lock.json` share one Node.js engine baseline, currently Node.js 22.19 or newer. The loader compatibility test verifies that this package's `engines.node` declaration stays identical to the installed locked Pi host package's declaration.

To advance the compatibility baseline, update the Pi development dependency ranges in `package.json` and refresh `package-lock.json` with `npm install`, reviewing both changes together. Then run the focused compatibility test, the full `npm test` suite, and `npm run typecheck` before committing the update. Do not narrow the Pi-hosted wildcard peer ranges to encode the baseline.

```bash
# alternatives
pi install git:github.com/coctostan/pi-hashline-readmap

git clone https://github.com/coctostan/pi-hashline-readmap.git
cd pi-hashline-readmap
npm install
pi install .
```

## 30-second read/edit

Create a disposable file, read it, and copy the returned `LINE:HASH` anchor:

```text
write({ path: "hashline-demo.txt", content: "hello, hashline!\n" })
read({ path: "hashline-demo.txt" })
1:f0c|hello, hashline!
```

Edit against that verified content:

```text
edit({
  path: "hashline-demo.txt",
  edits: [{ set_line: { anchor: "1:f0c", new_text: "hello, anchored edits!" } }]
})
```

If the file changed between `read` and `edit`, the edit reports a mismatch instead of touching the wrong line. Delete `hashline-demo.txt` when finished.

## Why use it?

- Tie edits to content-derived anchors rather than fragile line numbers.
- Jump to symbols, request maps, and include direct same-file support.
- Turn `grep` and `ast_search` results into edit-ready anchors.
- Read supported images through Pi attachments.
- Create with `write`; explore with `ls`, `find`, or optional Nushell.
- Compress noisy test, build, Git, Docker, linter, package-manager, and generic command output while retaining recovery paths.
- Use one coordinated extension instead of stacking overlapping read, grep, edit, and Bash-output packages.

## Common workflows

### Edit safely

Get fresh anchors from `read`, `grep`, `ast_search`, or `write`, then use `set_line`, `replace_lines`, or `insert_after`. Copy or move existing lines, within a file or from another file, with `copy_lines` and `move_lines` instead of retyping them. `replace` is an exact-text escape hatch. Deletion, overlap rejection, whole-symbol replacement, syntax checks, atomic writes, and structured diffs live in [tool behavior and structured output](docs/structured-output.md).

### Navigate large files

```text
read({ path: "src/hashline.ts", map: true })
read({ path: "src/read.ts", symbol: "registerReadTool", limit: 80 })
read({ path: "tests/fixtures/small.ts", symbol: "createDemoDirectory", map: true })
read({ path: "tests/fixtures/small.ts", symbol: "createDemoDirectory", limit: 2, bundle: "local", map: true })
```

A symbol can combine with `limit`, `map: true`, and `bundle: "local"`. `symbol+offset` is invalid, and bundle without `symbol` is invalid. Truncated full-file reads append a map when available. Dedicated mapper/runtime details are in [configuration and dependencies](docs/configuration.md).

### Search and explore

```text
grep({ pattern: "createDemoDirectory", path: "tests", literal: true })
grep({ pattern: "createDemoDirectory", path: "tests", summary: true })
grep({ pattern: "createDemoDirectory", path: "tests", scope: "symbol", scopeContext: 3 })
ast_search({ pattern: "console.log($$$ARGS)", lang: "typescript", path: "src", limit: 100 })
write({ path: "src/new-module.ts", content: "export const demo = 1;\n" })
ls({ path: "src", glob: "*.ts" })
find({ pattern: "*.test.ts", path: "tests", maxDepth: 2 })
nu({ command: "open package.json | get scripts" })
```

Normal grep output has anchors; summary mode has counts only. `ls` lists one directory, `find` recurses by basename and respects `.gitignore`, and `nu` registers only when Nushell is available.

## Bash output

`PI_RTK_BYPASS=1` skips route compression, but the default-on context guard can still trim oversized output. See [Bash compression and recovery](docs/bash-output.md) for routes, limits, snapshots, bypass behavior, and metadata.

## Configuration

Most users need none. Global settings live at `~/.pi/agent/hashline-readmap/settings.json`; project settings at `.pi/hashline-readmap/settings.json`; environment variables win. See [configuration and local dependencies](docs/configuration.md).

## Structured output and integrations

Results retain readable text and additive `details.ptcValue` records. See [structured output and codemode](docs/structured-output.md) and [integration surfaces](docs/integrations.md).

With Pi's `codemode` enabled (`"defaultTools": ["+codemode"]`), scripts get structured values instead of rendered text. For example, `await tools.read({ path })` resolves to `{ text, lines, ... }` with `LINE:HASH` anchors, and `tools.grep` records include each line's raw text. Scripts can chain `grep` → `edit` without parsing output. Tools also declare MCP-style read-only and destructive `annotations` for permission extensions. See [codemode integration](docs/structured-output.md#codemode-integration).

Required JSON `null` arguments are rejected before Pi can coerce them into strings or other scalars; optional nulls behave like omission, and the literal string `"null"` remains valid. Pi's preparation errors preserve the message and `isError`, but not custom structured error metadata. See [host-boundary null contracts](docs/structured-output.md#required-nulls-at-the-host-boundary).

## Context hygiene

Hashline tracks file, symbol, and command resources, signals staleness forward-only, and keeps hard anchor checks at edit time. See [context-hygiene metadata](docs/context-hygiene.md).

## Provider-visible metadata

Compact descriptions, parameter descriptions, snippets, and guidelines are provider-visible; full prompt bodies are detailed references. See the [constraint inventory and measured diagnosis](docs/tool-metadata.md).

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run build   # bundle the shippable dist/index.js entry
npm test        # builds dist/ first (pretest)
npm run typecheck
npm pack --dry-run
```

Pi loads the bundled `dist/index.js` entry declared in `package.json`
(`pi.extensions`). The bundle exists because Pi loads TypeScript extensions
through jiti, which resolves every module of a TS import graph file-by-file at
startup — several seconds on Windows. `npm test`, `npm pack`, and `npm publish`
build `dist/` automatically (`pretest`/`prepare`); `index.ts` remains the
TypeScript source entry and a fallback when `dist/` has not been built.
